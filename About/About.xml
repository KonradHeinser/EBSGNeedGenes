Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

This mod adds 57 new genes that change how quickly various need bars move. These genes will not increase the minimums or maximums, nor will they alter the strength or duration of things that affect the related needs. They only cause the bar to move more quickly to whatever destination is appropriate at that moment. For example, the mood genes added by this mod won't change where their final destination is, nor will they alter the thoughts themselves. They just change how long it takes for the current mood to reach the target mood.

The ranges included are:
 - Mood Genes (12) : Pessemism genes increase the rate mood falls while also decreasing the rate it recovers, while optimism genes do the reverse.
 - Comfort Genes (12) : Hedonism genes increase the rate comfort falls while also decreasing the rate it recovers, while Asceticism genes do the reverse. Hyper Asceticism completely disables the comfort need.
 - Beauty Genes (12) : Aesthete genes increase the rate beauty falls while also decreasing the rate it recovers, while Philistinism genes do the reverse. Hyper Philistinism completely disables the beauty need.
 - Recreation Genes (12) : Gloomy genes increase the rate recreation falls while also decreasing the rate it recovers, while Jovial genes do the reverse. Hyper Jovial completely disables the recreation need.
 - Kill Thirst Genes (9) : Murderous genes increase the rate kill satiety falls, while Placated genes slow the fall rate. These require the Kill Thirst Gene
